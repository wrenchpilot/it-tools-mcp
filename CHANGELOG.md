## [3.1.1] - 2025-07-09

### Fixed

- MCP server now outputs only JSON-RPC responses to stdout; all logs and timing output are sent to stderr.
- In test mode (`NODE_ENV=test`), the server exits cleanly after stdin closes, ensuring Docker/CI tests do not hang.
- Docker/CI test script (`tests/test-docker-setup.sh`) now sends both `initialize` and `tools/list` requests, and checks for correct JSON-RPC output.
- Fixed test script to set `NODE_ENV=test` for all docker runs and to robustly validate MCP protocol compliance.

### Changed

- Improved protocol compliance and robustness for Docker/CI environments.
- All resource/timing logs removed from stdout for strict MCP protocol adherence.
