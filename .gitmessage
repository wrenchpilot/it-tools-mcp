# Type should be one of the following:
# * feat     - A new feature
# * fix      - A bug fix
# * docs     - Documentation only changes
# * style    - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
# * refactor - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# * perf     - A code change that improves performance
# * test     - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
# * build    - Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
# * ci       - Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
# * chore    - Other changes that don't modify src or test files
# * revert   - Reverts a previous commit
#
# NOTE: Version bumping is done manually by updating package.json
# The CI/CD pipeline will automatically build, test, and publish when code changes
#
# Examples:
# feat: add new password generator tool
# fix: resolve issue with base64 encoding
# chore: update dependencies
# docs: improve README examples
#

# * Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")

# * No period at the end
# * Limit to 50 characters
#
# Body rules:
